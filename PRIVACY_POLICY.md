# Privacy Policy for Overwatch Progress Tracker

**Last updated: 20/02/2026**

This privacy policy describes how **Overwatch Progress Tracker** (“the app”) handles information when you use it. The app is designed to respect your privacy: we do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to our servers.

---

## 1. Overview

- **No account required.** You can use the app without signing in or creating an account.
- **Your data stays on your device.** Match history, stats, and settings are stored only in a local database on your phone or tablet.
- **We do not collect your data.** We do not operate servers that receive or store your match data, identity, or device identifiers.

---

## 2. Data Stored on Your Device

The app stores the following **only on your device**:

- **Match data** you enter (e.g. hero, map, result, rank, date/time)
- **Settings** (e.g. theme, accent color, default options)
- **Achievement progress** derived from your match data

This data is stored in a local database and is **not** sent to the developer or any third party by the app.

---

## 3. Optional Network Use (Meta Tab)

The app has an optional **Meta** feature that can load **public, anonymous community statistics** (e.g. hero pick rates and win rates) from a third-party or public URL. When this feature is used:

- The app may send a **request** to that URL to fetch statistics.
- **No personal data** (no account, no match history, no device ID) is sent with that request.
- Any data received is generic community stats, not tied to you.

---

## 4. Backup and Restore

- **Backup** creates a file (e.g. JSON) and saves it to a **location you choose** on your device (or to a folder you have configured, such as a cloud storage app’s folder).
- **Restore** reads a file **you select** from your device.
- The app **does not upload** your backup to the developer’s servers. Backup and restore stay between you and your chosen storage.

---

## 5. No Connection to Blizzard or Overwatch

The app **does not** connect to your Blizzard or Overwatch account. All match data is entered by you manually. We do not access, collect, or use any Blizzard or Overwatch account information.

---

## 6. Third-Party Services

- **Google Play (or other app stores):** If you install the app from an app store, that store may collect data according to its own policy (e.g. Google Play). This policy covers only the app itself, not the store.
- **Meta tab:** If the Meta feature fetches data from an external URL, that service is responsible for its own data practices. We do not control third-party websites or APIs.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided data through the app, please contact us (see below); the data would be stored only on the device and can be removed by uninstalling the app or clearing app data.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when changes are made. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. For significant changes, we may provide notice in the app or via the store listing.
